# QuoteGenerator

Simple Quotes Generator Using HTML, CSS and JS.

Tried using WikiQuotes API for the quotes but couldn't connect due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). 

Using Forsimatic API for the randomize quote generations which seems to have worked without blocking anything.

Looking into adding a search feature. So, typing the author's name will fetch and display the quotes by him/her.
